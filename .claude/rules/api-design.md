# API Design

## Cross-platform consistency

For **writes and mutations**, only expose features that work identically on
both iOS and Android. If a capability is read-only on one platform, it's
read-only in the plugin. No write support unless both platforms have it.

**Read-only data** is exempt: a value that only one platform provides MAY be
exposed as a nullable platform-specific field (e.g. `Event.colorHex`, which
Android reads from `EVENT_COLOR` and iOS always reports as `null`). Document
the per-platform behaviour on the field, and don't add write support unless
both platforms have it.

When a behaviour *can* be made consistent but the platforms naturally differ,
conform Android to iOS. iOS is the priority platform — it has most of the
users and revenue — so its default behaviour sets the contract. This is
usually also the practical direction: Android's Calendar Provider is
low-level and malleable, while iOS EventKit is opinionated and hard to
change. For example, `updateRecurring`'s `thisAndFollowing` split: iOS's
`EKSpan.futureEvents` decides where the series divides, and Android's manual
`UNTIL`-truncate split is built to match it.

## Typed APIs with raw escape hatch

Use `sealed class` hierarchies for types with distinct variants (e.g.
`RecurrenceRule` → `DailyRecurrence`, `WeeklyRecurrence`). Use `enum` for
finite flat sets (`EventAvailability`, `EventStatus`).

Preserve the raw platform string alongside parsed types for lossless
round-trips (e.g. `RecurrenceRule.rruleString` keeps the original RRULE even
when parsed into a typed subset that may not cover all features).

## Immutable models

Models (`Event`, `Calendar`) are immutable with final fields, factory
constructors from maps, and value equality. No setters.

## Platform-specific options

When one platform needs extra configuration that the other doesn't, use an
abstract `PlatformOptions` class with platform-specific subclasses (e.g.
`CreateCalendarPlatformOptions` → `CreateCalendarOptionsAndroid`). This keeps
the shared API surface clean.
