# Contributing to device_calendar_plus

**This project is closed to outside pull requests.**

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome - please open an issue. I'll handle the implementation myself to keep the API surface and platform-parity decisions consistent.

If you've already started on a fix, share your approach in the issue. It's useful context and I'll credit you in the changelog when the fix ships.

The rest of this document describes the design philosophy and conventions that guide implementation decisions. It's still worth reading if you want to understand why the API looks the way it does.

## Design Philosophy

This plugin prioritises **correctness and consistency over flexibility**. A few principles guide decision-making:

- **Calendar semantics, not database semantics.** Decisions should reflect how calendars actually work. All-day events are floating calendar dates, not instants in time. "January 15" means January 15 regardless of timezone.
- **Platform parity over platform power.** If a behaviour can't be made consistent across iOS and Android, we restrict the API rather than expose divergent behaviour. For example, recurring event updates always affect the entire series because not all platforms support single-instance modification.
- **Acknowledge platform differences, don't hide them.** Where platforms genuinely differ (iOS write-only permissions, Android account-based calendars), we surface that through typed options and documented enum values rather than papering over it.
- **Keep native code thin.** Business logic and data transformation belong in Dart where it's easier to test and maintain. Native code should focus on platform API calls and return raw data for Dart to process.

## DateTime Conventions

These conventions apply across the entire plugin. Any new feature that deals with dates must follow them.

- **All DateTimes cross the method channel as millisecondsSinceEpoch** (integers). Dart handles conversion to/from DateTime objects.
- **Event end dates use half-open intervals** `[start, end)`. The end date is the first moment *after* the event. A 1-hour meeting from 3pm has `endDate` of 4pm. An all-day event on January 15 has `startDate` Jan 15 00:00 and `endDate` Jan 16 00:00.
- **All-day events are floating dates.** They represent calendar dates, not instants in time. Do not convert them to UTC. The date components (year, month, day) must be preserved across timezone changes.
- **Timed events are instants.** They represent specific moments and can be freely converted to UTC.

## Platform Interface Contract

Both platform implementations must return data in the **same map shape**. The platform interface defines this contract — if a field exists in the Dart model's `fromMap()`, both platforms must populate it.

- Don't add a field to the Dart model unless both platforms return it. **Read-only data is exempt:** a value that only one platform provides may be exposed as a nullable platform-specific field (e.g. `Event.colorHex`, which Android reads from `EVENT_COLOR` and iOS always reports as `null`). Document the per-platform behaviour on the field, and don't add write support unless both platforms have it.
- Don't change the map shape for one platform without updating the other.
- If a platform-specific field needs write configuration, handle it through typed platform option classes (see `CreateCalendarOptionsAndroid` for an example).

## Architecture

This is a federated plugin. Changes to the API surface typically touch all four packages:

1. **`device_calendar_plus_platform_interface`** — Add the method signature or parameter.
2. **`device_calendar_plus_android`** — Implement for Android (Kotlin, Calendar Provider).
3. **`device_calendar_plus_ios`** — Implement for iOS (Swift, EventKit).
4. **`device_calendar_plus`** — Expose through the public Dart API with validation and documentation.

If you're adding a new field to an existing model, you need to handle both the **write path** (Dart → native) and the **read path** (native → Dart). Both must be tested. (Read-only fields only have a read path — test that.)

## Testing

### What to test

- **Integration tests** are the backbone. They exercise the full Dart → platform channel → native API roundtrip on real devices. These live in `example/integration_test/`.
- **Unit tests** for Dart-side logic with enough branches that you can't read it and immediately know it's correct (parsing, serialization, validation). These live in each package's `test/` directory.

Don't write unit tests that just assert a mock returns what you told it to return, or that verify method channel passthrough serialization in isolation — the integration tests cover those paths.

### Running tests

Unit tests (all packages):
```bash
very_good test --recursive
```

Integration tests:
```bash
cd example
./run_integration_tests.sh <device-id>
```

## Pull Requests

- **One feature per PR.** Each PR should branch off `main` and contain only its own changes.
- **Don't include version bumps.** Version bumps are handled by the maintainer at release time.
- **Update documentation.** If your change affects the public API, update the package README with usage examples.
- **All tests must pass** before requesting review.

## Code Style

- Run `dart format .` before committing.
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase. Look at how similar features are implemented before starting.
- Use `const` constructors and immutable models where possible.
- Enums should have safe factory methods with fallback defaults for unrecognised values.
- Validate inputs with `ArgumentError` at the Dart API boundary, before calling into the platform.

## Project Rules

There are Claude rules in `.claude/rules/` that document project conventions for API design, error handling, and testing. If you use Claude Code, these are loaded automatically. Otherwise, they're still worth reading — they capture decisions that apply to all contributions.
